	<p><b>Our algorithm</b> analyzes millions of real estate transactions and reviews to find our Realtor® for you. 
Top real estate agents are able to sell homes faster and for more money. Our hand-picked Realtors® go through a rigorous approval process which means we provide you with top talent and unbiased advice at no cost to you.</p>

<p><b>Better Research</b> - Because our research model is focused on actual real estate agent sales performance we are able to identify top real estate agents near you based on home sales data. While much of our success is a result of our algorithm's analytical methodology, there is a human element that sets us apart. Often, hidden in data are forces that can be explained with hands-on research.</p>

<p> <b>Buy the best Home and property</b> - Last year our shrewd buyer's agents saved our clients $12,409 compared to our national average sales price. Having a perceptive and tactful real estate agent will provide you with strategic help to reduce the amount you pay when it comes time to close.</p>

<p><b>Sell it Faster</b> - Our top ranked real estate agents outsell their peers by an average margin of 6:1. They are experts in staging, pricing and preparing homes for market. Top-selling real estate agents have a distinctly more developed sphere of influence. In short; they know how to generate a buzz, how to bring in multiple offers and how to get everyone to the closing table quickly.

<p><b>Sell for More</b>- Last year our top ranked real estate agents managed to beat the national average selling price of US existing homes by a whopping $16,349. Let's face it, if you are selling a home, you've probably got plans for the proceeds...often they include moving and buying another property, trading up, retiring or even downsizing - in just about any scenario...a little extra cash will come in handy.</p>
